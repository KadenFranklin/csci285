    "The Lorenz system is a set of ordinary differential equations that, while deterministic in its representation, exhibits chaotic solutions under certain conditions. Applications of the Lorenz system has led to the popularization of the term “butterfly effect” (i.e. even the minor disturbance of butterfly wings could cause hurricanes to form on the other side of the world).\n",

    "Using Euler’s method, solve and visualize the Lorenz system for x(t), y(t), and z(t) using line graphs, and produce “butterfly” phase portrait(s) by scatter plotting y(x), y(z), and x(z). For initial conditions, use σ = 10, β = 8/3, ρ = 28, x_0 = 2.0, y_0 = 5.0, and z_0 = 3.0. For the time range, you should choose n=30 (30 steps) to start. dt ~ 0.001.\n",
