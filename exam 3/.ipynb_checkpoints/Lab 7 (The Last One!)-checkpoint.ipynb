    "Now, revise the Tree lifecycle in the step method to incorporate the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Burned Out trees decay over time. Add a decay_time integer parameter to the model. Each tree that is burned should keep track of the time since it was burned. After the decay_time has passed, the tree decays, and its condition should be Empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine trees can grow new Fine trees in adjacent Empty neighbors. When a tree reaches the age of the lifetime parameter, the tree will try to change up to two adjacent Empty spaces into Fine trees, and set their age to 0. Then, the tree will change its own condition to Empty.\n",

Run each parameter choice 4 times. Determine the effect of changing this parameter on the number of Fine trees after 200 time steps."
