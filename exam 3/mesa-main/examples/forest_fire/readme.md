# Firefly model - Exam 3


All of the below work is my own. I adhered to the test-taking procedure by not receiving any help from my peers. I have cited all resources I found online or from notebooks shared from class that helped me complete this exam.

I could not get the visualization to run. The model was trying to iterare some unique_id or current_id when I tried to make a firefly.

Though from what I viewed in Dr. Goadrich's example it seems that for the initial parameters all of the fireflys will synchronize after about ten seconds.

I Imagine that the more you vary parameters such as flash_len, the more time it takes for the modeled fireflies to synchronize entirely. As fireflies are usually moving, increasing the flash length will make them percieve more flashes from their neighbors overall and put them off time.
